/**
 * Interface used to display warnings/errors while parsing the SDK content.
 * <p/>
 * There are a few default implementations available:
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link NullLogger} is an implementation that does <em>nothing</em> with the log.
 * Useful for limited cases where you need to call a class that requires a non-null logging
 * yet the calling code does not have any mean of reporting logs itself. It can be
 * acceptable for use as a temporary implementation but most of the time that means the caller
 * code needs to be reworked to take a logger object from its own caller.
 * </li>
 * <li> {@link StdLogger} is an implementation that dumps the log to {@link System#out} or
 * {@link System#err}. This is useful for unit tests or code that does not have any GUI.
 * GUI based apps based should not use it and should provide a better way to report to the user.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
